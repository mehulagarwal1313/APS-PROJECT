Spell Check and Correction System
This project is a C++ based spell checker that uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to find and suggest corrections for misspelled words. It loads a dictionary from a file and compares user input with the words in the dictionary. If a misspelled word is found, it generates a list of suggested corrections based on the Levenshtein distance and ranks them by edit distance.

Features
Spell Checking: Detects misspelled words in the input text.
Levenshtein Distance Algorithm: Calculates the minimum number of edits required to transform one word into another.
Suggested Corrections: Suggests candidate corrections for misspelled words based on edit distance.
Ranking of Suggestions: Ranks the suggestions by their similarity to the original word.
Dictionary Integration: Reads a dictionary file to validate words and generate corrections.
Requirements
C++11 or later
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
A dictionary text file (dictionary.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spell-checker.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd spell-checker
Compile the code:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o spell_checker main.cpp
Ensure that you have a dictionary.txt file in the project directory. You can use any dictionary file, or download one from various online sources.

Usage
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./spell_checker
When prompted, enter the text you want to check for spelling errors. The program will suggest possible corrections for any misspelled words it encounters.

Suggested corrections will be displayed in order of similarity (Levenshtein distance).

Example
Input:

vbnet
Copy code
Enter text to spell check: This is a sampl text with som mispelled words.
Output:

sql
Copy code
Suggestions for 'sampl':
sample

Suggestions for 'text':
textual

Suggestions for 'somp':
some

Suggestions for 'mispelled':
misspelled
How it works
The program splits the input text into individual words.
Each word is checked against a dictionary to see if it is valid.
For each misspelled word, the program generates a list of candidate corrections by calculating the Levenshtein distance for each word in the dictionary.
The candidates are ranked by how close they are to the misspelled word based on the edit distance.
The top suggestions are displayed to the user.
